    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I know I risk opening up the always controversial bags vs trailer debate but nonetheless I am going to throw in my tuppence worth. When on tours with my Brompton I have used combinations of the T-bag, Brompton rack pack, the O-bag and the City Freedom trailer and this is what I have found. I like a neat bike and one that does not look encumbered. If it doesn&rsquo;t fit in, it generally doesn&rsquo;t go. With the bag combination I have on occasions had to resort to wearing a small rucksack.</p>

<h2>Brompton Bags</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>The rack pack can, at a squeeze, carry my Terra Nova Superlite Voyager (minus poles), an ultra-lite synthetic sleeping bag, a silk liner and a Thermarest which means I can get set up at the end of the day without unpacking everything else and leave the tent up to the last moment.</p></li>
<li><p>The T-bag takes everything else. It&rsquo;s just broad enough to take the poles. My kitchen consists of an MSR Alpine kitchen kit, a Primus Ti stove, pocket rocket gas stove, one gas cannister and two unleaded fuel bottles. It&rsquo;s a squeeze but it fits.</p></li>
<li><p>Top of T-bag is a useful spot to place Power Monkey Extreme Solar Panels especially when cycling south. Strapping solar panel to rack pack is not ideal.</p></li>
<li><p>Airport check in staff do not look a Brompton bags with bewilderment.</p></li>
<li><p>I struggle to store a warm jacket and frequently I have to strap it to the top when solar panel not in use. I have to make do with a lightweight cycle jacket.</p></li>
<li><p>When using the T-bag with the rack pack I need three hands when the bike is folded  and I am getting on a train say.</p></li>
<li><p>Bike slightly unstable when parked and overfilled T-bag (which it nearly always is) can impede steering.</p></li>
<li><p>Water bottles have to be stored in mesh pockets which can be a tight squeeze when T-bag is full.</p></li>
<li><p>Nowhere to store a camera for easy access. Pockets OK for compact but not much bigger.</p></li>
<li><p>Appear to be reasonably waterproof and hard wearing. Fitting the waterproof cover to T-bag when full is a bit of a faff but it works and I do use it as it improves my visibleness in inclement weather.</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>City Freedom Trailer</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>Capacious single section where I can see everything at a glance. Tent poles fit comfortably.</p></li>
<li><p>I pack it differently everyday for some reason. Sometimes I seem to lose space. A bit of rummaging is necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>The two wheeled trailer is very stable and the drag doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a huge problem. I have slight misgivings about the bracing axle underneath which is held in place by a velcro strap. It has not however failed. When folded it is floppy and difficult to carry. Cable ties or bungees are usually necessary to keep everything in place.</p></li>
<li><p>Using only the O-bag and the trailer the bike looks neat and tidy.</p></li>
<li><p>Jackets can be stuffed into the mesh &ndash; as can water bottles. The top of the trailer is an ideal place for the solar panel as it is usually out of the shade.</p></li>
<li><p>Comes into its own when the bike is folded. Bike can be strapped on top of trailer which can then be used as a trolley suitcase. Numerous adjustments to straps are often necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>O-bag combination means place to store camera and valuables.</p></li>
<li><p>Airport staff don&rsquo;t know what to make of it and I have reserved its use for when I am going by car or by ferry.</p></li>
<li><p>It is often very difficult to find somewhere to park it outside restaurants, museums etc. I frequently clatter into bollards and other inanimate objects. The mudguards are no longer attached.</p></li>
<li><p>The wheels are 12&Prime; so that&rsquo;s another spare set of tubes to carry but I have not bothered as yet.</p></li>
</ol>
